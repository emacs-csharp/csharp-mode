This is a mode for editing C# in emacs. It's based on cc-mode, v5.30.3 and above.

[[https://travis-ci.org/josteink/csharp-mode/][Travis-CI build-page]]. Build-status: [[https://api.travis-ci.org/josteink/csharp-mode.png]]

** Main features

- font-lock and indent of C# syntax including:
  - all c# keywords and major syntax
  - attributes that decorate methods, classes, fields, properties
  - enum types
  - #if/#endif #region/#endregion
  - instance initializers
  - anonymous functions and methods
  - verbatim literal strings (those that begin with @)
  - generics 
- automagic code-doc generation when you type three slashes.
- intelligent insertion of matched pairs of curly braces.
- imenu indexing of C# source, for easy menu-based navigation. 
- compilation-mode support for msbuild, devenv and xbuild.

** Usage

This package is currently available on MELPA & Marmalade. Install using
~M-x package-install<RET>csharp-mode~.

Once installed the package should be automatically used for files with a '.cs'-extension.

Note: This package is also available on [[http://stable.melpa.org/][MELPA-stable]] for those who don't want or need
bleeding edge development-versions.

For a better experience you may want to enable electric-pair-mode when editing C#-files.
To do so, add the following to your .emacs-file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my-csharp-mode-hook ()
    ;; enable the stuff you want for C# here
    (electric-pair-mode 1))
  (add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook 'my-csharp-mode-hook)
#+END_SRC

For further mode-specific customization, ~M-x customize-group RET csharp RET~ will show available settings with documentation. For configuring ~cc-mode~ settings (which csharp-mode derives from) see the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ccmode.html][cc-mode manual]].

For more advanced and IDE-like functionality we recommend using csharp-mode together
with [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs][Omnisharp-Emacs]].

* Attribution

This repo is a fork of the code originally developed by Dylan R. E. Moonfire and
further maintained by Dino Chiesa as hosted on [[https://code.google.com/p/csharpmode/][Google code]].

** New focus

The original csharp-mode repo contained lots of different code for lots of different purposes,
some finished, some not, some experimental, some not. Basiaclly things like ASPX-mode, TFS-mode,
code completion backends, etc.

All this original code can still be found in the [[https://github.com/josteink/csharp-mode/tree/extras][extras-branch]], but we have decided to
go for a more focused approach and to throw out all dead or unused code, code we wont
be maintaining.

The goal: That what we package in csharp-mode actually works and works well.
