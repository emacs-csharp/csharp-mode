;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    This is a major mode for editing C# code.  It performs automatic
;;    indentation of C# syntax; font locking; and integration with
;;    imenu.el.
;;
;;    csharp-mode requires CC Mode 5.30 or later.  It works with
;;    cc-mode 5.31.3, which is current at this time.
;;
;; Features:
;;
;;   - font-lock and indent of C# syntax including:
;;       all c# keywords and major syntax
;;       attributes that decorate methods, classes, fields, properties
;;       enum types
;;       #if/#endif  #region/#endregion
;;       instance initializers
;;       anonymous functions and methods
;;       verbatim literal strings (those that begin with @)
;;       generics
;;
;;   - automagic code-doc generation when you type three slashes.
;;
;;   - compatible with electric-pair-mode for intelligent insertion
;;     of matched braces, quotes, etc.
;;
;;   - imenu integration - generates an index of namespaces, classes,
;;     interfaces, methods, and properties for easy navigation within
;;     the buffer.
;;


;; Installation instructions
;; --------------------------------
;;
;; Put csharp-mode.el somewhere in your load path, optionally byte-compile
;; it, and add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'csharp-mode "csharp-mode" "Major mode for editing C# code." t)
;;   (setq auto-mode-alist
;;      (append '(("\\.cs$" . csharp-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
;;
;;
;; Optionally, define and register a mode-hook function.  To do so, use
;; something like this in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (defun my-csharp-mode-fn ()
;;      "function that runs when csharp-mode is initialized for a buffer."
;;      (turn-on-auto-revert-mode)
;;      (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
;;      ...insert more code here...
;;      ...including any custom key bindings you might want ...
;;   )
;;   (add-hook  'csharp-mode-hook 'my-csharp-mode-fn t)
;;
;;
;;  General
;;  ----------------------------
;;
;;  Mostly C# mode will "just work."  Use `describe-mode' to see the
;;  default keybindings and the highlights of the mode.
;;
;;
;;  imenu integration
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  This should just work.  For those who don't know what imenu is, it
;;  allows navigation to different points within the file from an
;;  "Index" menu, in the window's menubar.  csharp-mode computes the
;;  menu containing the namespaces, classes, methods, and so on, in the
;;  buffer.  This happens at the time the file is loaded; for large
;;  files it takes a bit of time to complete the scan.  If you don't
;;  want this capability, set `csharp-want-imenu' to nil.
;;
;;


;;; Known Bugs:
;;
;;   The imenu scan is text-based and naive. For example, if you
;;   intersperse comments between the name of a class/method/namespace,
;;   and the curly brace, the scan will not recognize the thing being
;;   declared. This is fixable - would need to extract the buffer
;;   substring then remove comments before doing the regexp checks - but
;;   it would make the scan much slower.  Also, the scan doesn't deal
;;   with preproc symbol definitions and #if/#else. Those things are
;;   invisible to the scanner csharp-mode uses to build the imenu menu.
;;
;;   Leading identifiers are no longer being fontified, for some reason.
;;   See matchers-before. (Not sure this is still a problem - 19 may
;;   2011 DPC)
;;
;;   Method names with a preceding attribute are not fontified.
;;
;;   The symbol followng #if is not fontified.  It should be treated like
;;   define and get font-lock-variable-name-face .
;;
;;   This code doesn't seem to work when you compile it, then
;;   load/require in the emacs file. You will get an error (error
;;   "`c-lang-defconst' must be used in a file") which happens because
;;   cc-mode doesn't think it is in a buffer while loading directly
;;   from the init. However, if you call it based on a file extension,
;;   it works properly. Interestingly enough, this doesn't happen if
;;   you don't byte-compile cc-mode.
;;
;;
;;
;;  Todo:
;;
;;   imenu should scan for and find delegates and events, in addition
;;   to the classes, structs, properties and methods it does currently.
;;
;;   Get csharp-mode.el accepted as part of the emacs standard distribution.
;;   Must contact monnier at iro.umontreal.ca to make this happen.
;;
;;   Add refactoring capabilities?
;;     - extract as method - extract a block of code into a method
;;     - extract as Func<> - extract a block of code into an Action<T>
;;
;;   More code-gen power:
;;     - interface implementation - I think would require csharp-shell
;;
;;
;;  Acknowledgements:
;;
;;    Thanks to Alan Mackenzie and Stefan Monnier for answering questions
;;    and making suggestions. And to Trey Jackson for sharing his
;;    knowledge of emacs lisp.

;;; Versions:
;;
;;    0.1.0 - Initial release.
;;    0.2.0 - Fixed the identification on the "enum" keyword.
;;          - Fixed the font-lock on the "base" keyword
;;    0.3.0 - Added a regex to fontify attributes. It isn't the
;;            the best method, but it handles single-like attributes
;;            well.
;;          - Got "super" not to fontify as a keyword.
;;          - Got extending classes and interfaces to fontify as something.
;;    0.4.0 - Removed the attribute matching because it broke more than
;;            it fixed.
;;          - Corrected a bug with namespace not being properly identified
;;            and treating the class level as an inner object, which screwed
;;            up formatting.
;;          - Added "partial" to the keywords.
;;    0.5.0 - Found bugs with compiled cc-mode and loading from init files.
;;          - Updated the eval-when-compile to code to let the mode be
;;            compiled.
;;    0.6.0 - Added the c-filter-ops patch for 5.31.1 which made that
;;            function in cc-langs.el unavailable.
;;          - Added a csharp-lineup-region for indention #region and
;;            #endregion block differently.
;;    0.7.0 - Added autoload so update-directory-autoloads works
;;            (Thank you, Nikolaj Schumacher)
;;          - Fontified the entire #region and #endregion lines.
;;          - Initial work to get get, set, add, remove font-locked.
;;    0.7.1 - Added option to indent #if/endif with code
;;          - Fixed c-opt-cpp-prefix defn (it must not include the BOL
;;            char (^).
;;          - proper fontification and indent of classes that inherit
;;            (previously the colon was confusing the parser)
;;          - reclassified namespace as a block beginner
;;          - removed $ as a legal symbol char - not legal in C#.
;;          - added struct to c-class-decl-kwds so indent is correct
;;            within a struct.
;;    0.7.2 - Added automatic codedoc insertion.
;;    0.7.3 - Instance initializers (new Type { ... } ) and
;;            (new Type() { ...} ) are now indented properly.
;;          - proper fontification and indent of enums as brace-list-*,
;;            including special treatment for enums that explicitly
;;            inherit from an int type. Previously the colon was
;;            confusing the parser.
;;          - proper fontification of verbatim literal strings,
;;            including those that end in slash. This edge case was not
;;            handled at all before; it is now handled correctly.
;;          - code cleanup and organization; removed the formfeed.
;;          - intelligent curly-brace insertion with
;;            `csharp-insert-open-brace'
;;    0.7.4 - added a C# style
;;          - using is now a keyword and gets fontified correctly
;;          - fixed a bug that had crept into the codedoc insertion.
;;    0.7.5 - now fontify namespaces in the using statements. This is
;;            done in the csharp value for c-basic-matchers-before .
;;          - also fontify the name following namespace decl.
;;            This is done in the csharp value for c-basic-matchers-after .
;;          - turn on recognition of generic types. They are now
;;            fontified correctly.
;;          - <> are now treated as syntactic parens and can be jumped
;;            over with c-forward-sexp.
;;          - Constructors are now fontified.
;;          - Field/Prop names inside object initializers are now fontified.
;;
;;    0.7.7 - relocate running c-run-mode-hooks to the end of
;;            csharp-mode, to allow user to modify key bindings in a
;;            hook if he doesn't like the defaults.
;;
;;    0.7.8 - redefine csharp-log to insert timestamp.
;;          - Fix byte-compile errors on emacs 23.2 ?  Why was
;;            c-filter-ops duplicated here?  What was the purpose of its
;;            presence here, I am not clear.
;;
;;    0.8.0 - include flymake magic into this module.
;;          - include yasnippet integration
;;
;;    0.8.2 2011 April DPC
;;          - small tweaks; now set a one-time bool for flymake installation
;;          - some doc updates on flymake

;;          - imenu integration for menu-driven navigation - navigate to
;;            named methods, classes, etc.
;;          - adjusted the flymake regexp to handle output from fxcopcmd,
;;            and extended the help to provide examples how to use this.
;;
;;    0.8.4 DPC 2011 May 18
;;          - fix a basic bug in the `csharp-yasnippet-fixup' fn.

It returns t if at a position where a virtual-semicolon is.

This is the C# version of the function.  It gets set into
the variable `c-at-vsemi-p-fn'.

A vsemi is a cc-mode concept implying the end of a statement,
where no actual end-of-statement signifier character ( semicolon,
close-brace) appears.  The concept is used to allow proper
indenting of blocks of code: Where a vsemi appears, the following
line will not indent further.

A vsemi appears in 2 cases in C#:

 - after an attribute that decorates a class, method, field, or
   property.

 - in an object initializer, before the open-curly?

An example of the former is  [WebMethod] or [XmlElement].

Providing this function allows the indenting in `csharp-mode'
to work properly with code that includes attributes."

;; The matchers elements can be of many forms.  It gets pretty
;; complicated.  Do a describe-variable on font-lock-keywords to get a
;; description.  (Why on font-lock-keywords? I don't know, but that's
;; where you get the help.)
;;
;; Aside from the provided documentation, the other option of course, is
;; to look in the source code as an example for what to do.  The source
;; in cc-fonts uses a defun c-make-font-lock-search-function to produce
;; most of the matchers.  Called this way:
;;
;;   (c-make-font-lock-search-function  regexp '(A B c))
;;
;; The REGEXP is used in re-search-forward, and if there's a match, then
;; A is called within a save-match-data. If B and C are non-nil, they
;; are called as pre and post blocks, respecitvely.
;;
;; Anyway the c-make-font-lock-search-function works for a single regex,
;; but more complicated scenarios such as those intended to match and
;; fontify object initializers, call for a hand-crafted lambda.
;;
;; The object initializer is special because matching on it must
;; allow nesting.
;;
;; In c#, the object initializer block is used directly after a
;; constructor, like this:
;;
;;     new MyType
;;     {
;;        Prop1 = "foo"
;;     }
;;
;; csharp-mode needs to fontify the properties in the
;; initializer block in font-lock-variable-name-face. The key thing is
;; to set the text property on the open curly, using type c-type and
;; value c-decl-id-start. This apparently allows `parse-partial-sexp' to
;; do the right thing, later.
;;
;; This simple case is easy to handle in a regex, using the basic
;; `c-make-font-lock-search-function' form.  But the general syntax for a
;; constructor + object initializer in C# is more complex:
;;
;;     new MyType(..arglist..) {
;;        Prop1 = "foo"
;;     }
;;
;; A simple regex match won't satisfy here, because the ..arglist.. can
;; be anything, including calls to other constructors, potentially with
;; object initializer blocks. This may nest arbitrarily deeply, and the
;; regex in emacs doesn't support balanced matching.  Therefore there's
;; no way to match on the "outside" pair of parens, to find the relevant
;; open curly.  What's necessary is to do the match on "new MyType" then
;; skip over the sexp defined by the parens, then set the text property on
;; the appropriate open-curly.
;;
;; To make that happen, it's good to have insight into what the matcher
;; really does.  The output of `c-make-font-lock-search-function' before
;; byte-compiling, is:
;;
;; (lambda (limit)
;;   (let ((parse-sexp-lookup-properties
;;          (cc-eval-when-compile
;;            (boundp 'parse-sexp-lookup-properties))))
;;     (while (re-search-forward REGEX limit t)
;;       (unless
;;           (progn
;;             (goto-char (match-beginning 0))

;; (defun c-make-font-lock-search-function (regexp &rest highlights)
;;     ;; This function makes a byte compiled function that works much like
;;     ;; a matcher element in `font-lock-keywords'.  It cuts out a little
;;     ;; bit of the overhead compared to a real matcher.  The main reason
;;     ;; is however to pass the real search limit to the anchored
;;     ;; matcher(s), since most (if not all) font-lock implementations
;;     ;; arbitrarily limits anchored matchers to the same line, and also
;;     ;; to insulate against various other irritating differences between
;;     ;; the different (X)Emacs font-lock packages.
;;     ;;
;;     ;; REGEXP is the matcher, which must be a regexp.  Only matches
;;     ;; where the beginning is outside any comment or string literal are
;;     ;; significant.
;;     ;;
;;     ;; HIGHLIGHTS is a list of highlight specs, just like in
;;     ;; `font-lock-keywords', with these limitations: The face is always
;;     ;; overridden (no big disadvantage, since hits in comments etc are
;;     ;; filtered anyway), there is no "laxmatch", and an anchored matcher
;;     ;; is always a form which must do all the fontification directly.
;;     ;; `limit' is a variable bound to the real limit in the context of

;; This is the kind of thing that could be handled by YASnippet or

(defun csharp-maybe-insert-codedoc (arg)
  "Insert an xml code documentation template on third consecutive slash.
This fn gets bound to / (the slash key), in
‚Äòcsharp-mode‚Äô.  If the slash being inserted is not the third
consecutive slash, the slash is inserted as normal.  If it is the
third consecutive slash, then a xml code documentation template
may be inserted in some cases.  For example,

  a <summary> template is inserted if the prior line is empty,
        or contains only an open curly brace;
  a <remarks> template is inserted if the prior word
        closes the <summary> element;
  a <returns> template is inserted if the prior word
        closes the <remarks> element;
  an <example> template is inserted if the prior word closes
        the <returns> element;
  a <para> template is inserted if the prior word closes
        a <para> element.

In all other cases the slash is inserted as normal.

The prefix argument ARG is passed on to `self-insert-command'
when the code documentation template isn't triggered.  This makes
sure that M-10 / still produces 10 consecutive slashes as expected.

insertion of xml code documentation templates, then use this in

(define-derived-mode csharp-mode prog-mode "C#"
  "Major mode for editing C# code.

The mode provides fontification and indent for C# syntax, as well
as some other handy features.

At mode startup, there are two interesting hooks that run:
`prog-mode-hook' is run with no args, then `csharp-mode-hook' is run after
that, also with no args.

To run your own logic after csharp-mode starts, do this:

  (defun my-csharp-mode-fn ()
    \"my function that runs when csharp-mode is initialized for a buffer.\"
    (turn-on-font-lock)
    (turn-on-auto-revert-mode) ;; helpful when also using Visual Studio
    (setq indent-tabs-mode nil) ;; tabs are evil
    ....your own code here...
  )
  (add-hook  'csharp-mode-hook 'my-csharp-mode-fn t)


The function above is just a suggestion.


Imenu Integration
===============================

Check the menubar for menu entries for Imenu; it is labelled
\"Index\".

The Imenu index gets computed when the file is .cs first opened and loaded.
This may take a moment or two.  If you don't like this delay and don't
use Imenu, you can turn this off with the variable `csharp-want-imenu'.

  ;; syntax-properties of the text, and that should ideally be
  ;; independent of font-lock being activated or not.
  ;;
  ;; For csharp-mode, this means that with font-lock disabled, we wont
  ;; have our syntax-properties set correctly, and indentation will
  ;; suffer.
  ;;
  ;; To patch our way around this, we issue a syntax-propertize call
  ;; manually, font-lock enabled or not.
